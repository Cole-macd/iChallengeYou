# iChallengeYou

We are developing an iOS app, iChallengeYou, to help people make quick decisions with friends easily and fairly over their smartphones. This will happen through simple games such as Rock Paper Scissors, Tic-Tac-Toe, Coin Flips, and others. A user will send a “challenge” to his friend with the game of his choice, and the friend can accept the challenge, respond to the opponent’s move, and the application will alert the original user through push notifications when the winner of the game is decided.
